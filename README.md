## Hello There, I'm MrTinEU 👋
There are just two kinds of people, ones which get asked to fix the printer and ones which ask to fix the printer.
## Something about me 📃
- I'm a highschool student in Slovakia, studying **software development** 📘
- Logistics and inner workings of the world always intrested me(that's why I love Factorio) ⚙️
- Intrested in economics💵, math🖩 and space🚀
## Programming languages
- Python <img src = 'https://github.com/MarikIshtar007/MarikIshtar007/blob/master/images/python2.png' height='15'/> (I know this best, used it in lot of usecases)
- Javascript <img src = 'https://github.com/MarikIshtar007/MarikIshtar007/blob/master/images/js.svg' width='15'/> (don't do frontend in python, trust me)
- Kotlin <img src = 'https://github.com/MarikIshtar007/MarikIshtar007/blob/master/images/kotlin.svg' width='15'/> (I despise Java<img src='https://github.com/MarikIshtar007/MarikIshtar007/blob/master/images/java.svg' width='15'/> so I use this instead for Android development)
- HTML <img src = 'https://github.com/MarikIshtar007/MarikIshtar007/blob/master/images/html.svg' width='15'/> (I know it's not a programming language, but where would I put it?)
- CSS  <img src = 'https://github.com/MarikIshtar007/MarikIshtar007/blob/master/images/css.svg' width='15'/> (required blasphemy)
- C# <img src = "https://github.com/mrtineu/mrtineu/blob/main/c-sharp-c.svg" width='15' />(better Java<img src='https://github.com/MarikIshtar007/MarikIshtar007/blob/master/images/java.svg' width='15'/>)
